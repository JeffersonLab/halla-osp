Hll A OSP Documentation Source (fix this)
===============================
        
Introduction
------------
The Hall A OSP (Operation Safety Procedures) document describes  
the systems, devices and procedures used in Hall A, including
safety issues. The systems include, for example, the HRS
scintillation counters, the HRS magnets, the Moller polarimeter,
etc.

The purpose of this package is to produce the Hall A OSP manual
in PDF and HTML formats. It contains the source of the text, 
the pictures and tools to make the documents. 

Top directory, static:
src/ - the source (LaTeX) and pictures
scripts/ - auxiliary scripts and the makefile
mics/ - miscellaneous documents - not used regularly

Top directory, dynamic:
run/ - work directory to create the documents

One can create the OSP document with different levels of
detail (noted as "infolevel"), the lower the value, 
the more slim is the document. All the levels contain the 
basic safety information for every system. Additional 
information depends on the level:
infolevel=0 - a short (1 page) description per system including 
              a picture for the layout if needed;
infolevel=1 - plus a description of the system's components;
infolevel=2 - plus a description of the procedures and pictures, 
              like MEDM windows in PNG format;  
infolevel=3 - plus the main principles of the devices' operation;
infolevel=4 - plus photographs and other large pictures
 
Producing the Documents:
-----------------------
In order to produce the OSP document with, say, infolevel=4 one 
has to:
1) ./scripts/config osp 4   (in the top directory)
   This creates a work directory run/ to produce the document 
2) cd run/
3) make pdf  - to create the document (osp.pdf) in PDF format 
4) make html - to create the document (in osp_html/) in HTML format

Browsing the PDF document: 
-------------------------
The PDF can be viewed with Acrobat Reader or xpdf (on Linux).
Both browsers can search for a given word. Also, the 
document contains hyper-references both inside the document
(so, one can jump forth and back to, say, the literature 
references), and also outside, using the standard URL.
In order to use the external references one may need 
to configure the browsers. Use the "Edit/Preference" button
on acroread. For xpdf you may need to copy /etc/xpdfrc
to ~/.xpdfrc and edit it, uncommenting the line
#urlCommand     "netscape -remote 'openURL(%s)'"
and commenting out the previous line.
Typically, xpdf/acroread tries to use an existing WWW browser
window and does not open a new window.
