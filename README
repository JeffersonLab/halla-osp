Updated instructions Mar 2023 
==================================
Updated instructions for producing the COO, ESAD and OPS manual

Running doit in the maim hallc_osp directory creates the ops manual and the ESAD in the version subdirectory.  
The ESAD is osp-level0.pdf and the manual is osp-level4.pdf.

The COO is in src/coo and is build with doit that is the src/coo.  
Usually it is sufficient to edit coo_halla_defs.tex which 
defines experiment numbers, liaison names etc.

There is a figure in the COO that is made with xfig.  
You can probably just edit the coo_HallAorg.fig by hand 
Running "doit" in the src/coo directory will generate 
 will generate the figure as long as the fig2dev utility is installed.
Need to be on the jlabl computers which have fig2dev utility.


ESAD
----
The LaTeX files in this repository build both the operating
manual and the ESAD.  The ESAD Introduction (Chapter1) and General
Hazards (Chapter2) are located at:

src/esad

The rest of the ESAD materials are pulled directly from the operations manual
either as level zero, safety, or uncommented information.
