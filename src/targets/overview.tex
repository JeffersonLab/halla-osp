The physics program in Hall A utilizes a number of different
target systems of varying complexity. There is a set of
cryogenic targets which currently operates with hydrogen and deuterium
as target materials and will soon support both helium 3 and
helium 4.

A variety of solid targets is also provided; Be0, Carbon or
Kapton are typical but other self supporting materials are available if need arises.

The combination of cryogenic targets and a few solid targets is
the standard configuration. In addition,
there is a large program based on polarized helium 3. This
is a special installation and hence is not available at the same
time as the cryogenic target system.

Finally, a waterfall target was used during the commissioning of
the hall and is still available as a resource. This system
also requires a special installation.

Each of these systems is discussed in this chapter or in an appendix.
