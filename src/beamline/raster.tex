\section{Fast Raster}

The beam is rastered on target with an amplitude of
several millimeters to prevent overheating.  
The raster is a pair of horizontal (X) and vertical (Y)
air-core dipoles located 23 m upstream of the
target. The raster has been used in two different modes,
sinusoidal and amplitude modulated. In the sinusoidal pattern
both the X and Y magnet pairs are driven with pure sine waves
with $90^{\circ}$ relative phase, 
and frequencies which do not produce a closed Lissajous pattern.
In the amplitude modulated (or square root of time) mode  
both the X and Y magnets are driven at 18 kHz with
a $90^{\circ}$ phase between X and Y producing  a circular
pattern. The radius of this pattern is changed by amplitude
modulation at 1 kHz. The radius modulation
is controlled by a function generator whose function
creates a uniform distribution of the area swept out
by the beam motion. It is not possible to switch on the fly
between the two modes of operation as hardware changes are required.

One can view the status of the raster in the
EPICS overview screen called ``General Accelerator
Parameters'' where the set-point for the radius amplitude
and the readback of the peak-current in the raster are displayed.

Control of the raster is done by first asking the MCC
operators to set up the raster for a particular radius, 
typically 2.5 mm.
The control software assumes a field-free region between
the raster and the target, so it is only approximately
correct because there are four quadrupoles in this region.
It is important to check the raster spot size and
make adjustments if necessary.  The main adjustment is made
by asking MCC to change the radius.
Relatively small independent adjustments to the 
gains on the X and the Y raster
coils are available in the middle room of the hall A
counting room using the ``PGA Controller'' knobs.
Near these knobs is also located an oscilloscope X-Y trace
of the current in the raster.  A fast shutdown (FSD) shuts
the beam down within 0.1 msec if the raster fails, thus
affording some protection of the target.

{\it NOTE:  If you are unsure of the status of the raster,
measure the spot size with very low current ($\le 2 \mu$A) or with
the target out of the beam.}  An unfortunately common and 
potentially fatal error 
is to check the beam spot size with high current on target; by
the time you check it, the target might already be destroyed.
The rastered beam spot on target can be checked with
plots in ESPACE or by using the stand alone code called ``spot''.
Spot is probably already running somewhere; it runs on the 
Linux or Sun computers in the counting room; if it's not
running, type ``spot''.  When a new CODA run is started,
spot automatically clears its histograms and displays 
in a window the X-Y beam position monitor
coordinates from the first few thousand events from the
start of the run.  
For more details on usage, type ``spot -h'' (help).
