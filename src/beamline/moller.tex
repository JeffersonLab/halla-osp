The Hall A beam line is equipped with a M{\o}ller 
polarimeter
whose purpose is 
to measure the polarization of the electron beam delivered to the hall. 

\begin{safetyen}{0}{0}

The M{\o}ller Polarimeter system has under gone a major upgrade and an Operational Safety Proceedure (OSP)
is being written and must be reviewed before its use.

\subsection{Hazards and Mitigations}
