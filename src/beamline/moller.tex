\section {Purpose and Layout}
\label{sec:moller_purpose}

The Hall A beam line is equipped with a M{\o}ller 
polarimeter
whose purpose is 
to measure the polarization of the electron beam delivered to the hall.

The M{\o}ller polarimeter consists of (see Fig.\ref{fig:moller_layout}):
\begin{itemize}
\item  a magnetized ferromagnetic foil used as a polarized electron target,
       placed 17.5 m upstream of the central 
       pivot point of the Hall A High Resolution Spectrometers;

\item a spectrometer consisting of three quadrupole magnets and a dipole magnet,
      used to deflect the electrons scattered in a certain kinematic
      range towards the M{\o}ller detector;

\item a detector and its associated shielding house;
\item a stand alone data acquisition system;
\item off-line analysis software which helps to extract the beam polarization
      from the data immediately after the data are taken. 
\end{itemize}

The beam polarization is measured by measuring the difference
in the counting rates for two beam helicity samples.  
%This document discusses the safe operation of the M{\o}ller polarimeter

\section {Principles of Operation}
\label{sec:moller_principles}

The cross-section of the M{\o}ller scattering 
$ \vec{e^-} + \vec{e^-} \rightarrow e^- + e^-$
depends on the beam and target polarizations ${\cal P}^{beam}$ and 
${\cal P}^{target}$ as:
\begin{equation}
         \sigma \propto ( 1 +  
            \sum_{i=X,Y,Z} (A_{ii}\cdot{}{\cal P}^{targ}_{i}\cdot{}{\cal P}^{beam}_{i})) , 
\end{equation}
where $i = X,Y,Z$ defines the projections of the polarizations. 
The analyzing power $A$ depends on the scattering angle in the CM frame 
$\theta{}_{CM}$. 
Assuming that the beam direction is along the Z-axis and that the scattering
happens in the ZX plane:
\begin{equation}
         A_{ZZ} = 
            -\frac{\sin^2\theta{}_{CM}\cdot(7+\cos^2\theta{}_{CM})}
                                   {(3+\cos^2\theta{}_{CM})^2},
         A_{XX} = -\frac{\sin^4\theta{}_{CM}}
                       {(3 + \cos^2\theta{}_{CM})^2},
         A_{YY} = -A_{XX}
\end{equation}

The analyzing power does not depend on 
the beam energy.
At $\theta{}_{CM}=90^o$ the analyzing power has its maximum $A_{ZZ}^{max}=7/9$. 
A transverse polarization also leads to an asymmetry, though the analyzing power is 
lower:  $A_{XX}^{max}=A_{ZZ}^{max}/7$. The main purpose of the polarimeter
is to measure the longitudinal component of the beam polarization.
 
The M{\o}ller polarimeter of Hall A detects pairs of scattered electrons in a 
range of $ 75^o < \theta{}_{CM} < 105^o$. The average analyzing power 
is about $<A_{ZZ}>=0.76$.

The target consists of a thin magnetically saturated ferromagnetic foil.
In such a material about 2 electrons per atom can be 
polarized. An average electron polarization of about 8\% can be obtained.
In Hall A M{\o}ller polarimeter the foil is magnetized along its plane and
can be tilted at angles $20-160^o$ to the beam. The effective target 
polarization is 
${\cal P}^{target}={\cal P}^{foil}\cdot{}\cos\theta{}^{target}$.

The secondary electron pairs pass through a magnetic spectrometer
which selects particles in a certain kinematic region. Two electrons
are detected with a two-arm detector and the 
coincidence counting rate of the two arms is measured.

The beam longitudinal polarization is measured as:
\begin{equation}
           {\cal P}^{beam}_{Z} = \frac{N_{+}-N_{-}}{N_{+}+N_{-}}\cdot{}
      \frac{1}{{\cal P}^{foil}\cdot{}\cos\theta{}^{target}\cdot{}<A_{ZZ}>},
\end{equation}
where $N_{+}$ and $N_{-}$ are the measured counting rates with two opposite
mutual orientation of the beam and target polarizations, while 
$<A_{ZZ}>$ is obtained using Monte-Carlo calculation of the M{\o}ller 
spectrometer acceptance, ${\cal P}^{foil}$ is derived from special
magnetization measurements of the foil samples and $\theta{}^{target}$
is measured using a scale, engraved on the target holder and seen
with a TV camera, and also using the counting rates measured at
different target angles.

Two target holders have been used:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Before Nov, 2004 the target foil could be rotated in the horizontal plane.
  The beam polarization may have a horizontal 
  transverse component, which would interact with the horizontal transverse 
  component of the target polarization. The way to cancel the influence
  of the transverse component is to take an average of the asymmetries
  measured at 2 complimentary target angles, say 25 and $155^\circ$. 
  \item After Nov, 2004 several target foils are tilted at $\sim{}20^\circ$
       to the beam, in the vertical plane. The vertical beam polarization is very small
       and only the longitudinal component of the beam polarization
       contributes to the asymmetry measured.
\end{itemize}

 Several components of the polarimeter, namely the target position and
 the current in the magnets can be checked
 using the regular MEDM~\cite{MEDMwww}/EDM program of Machine Control Center (MCC). The appropriate

the values in this window.

\subsection{Polarized Electron Target }
\label{sec:moller_compon_targ}

The M{\o}ller Polarized Electron Target is
placed on the beamline 17.5 m upstream of the main Hall A
physics target.

The target consists of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A sliding rail which contains 5 ferromagnetic foils, stretched at
        $20^\circ$ to the beam in the vertical plane. The rail can
        move the target foils across the beam in two projections.
  \item An air-core magnet consisting of two coils coaxial with the beam,
        used to magnetize the target foils.
\end{itemize}


\infolevfour{

   The rail with 5 foils is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:moller_targ_rail}.

Two target slots exist, called ``bottom'' and ``top''.
For the M{\o}ller target at the moment
a supermendur foil 12~$\mu$m thick is used, positioned in the ``bottom''

position.  
The foil can be tilted to the beam at an angle required,
in a range from $20^o$ to $160^o$.

\infolevtwo{
The target rail can be moved horizontally, placing different foils
into the beam. The whole target holder can also be moved along
another rail, tilted at $20^\circ$ to the beam, as the foils are tilted.
This allows to scan the beam along the foil. Both motions put no material
in the beam, apart from the thin foils, and can be carried out while 
the beam is on, at beam currents below $2~\mu$A.

\obsolete{
Both vertical movement of the target and its rotation is controlled by the 
Machine Control Center (MCC)
operators. The vertical movement is controlled by 3 buttons
on the M{\o}ller MEDM display, named ``center'', ``bottom'' and ``top''.
Rotation is controlled by typing an angle, measured in certain units,
in a ``rotary'' window and pressing RETURN. The size of the unit is defined
by the end switches which stop the target rotation at low and high
end points. The distance between these 2 switches is about $140^o$,
and this distance is divided into 80 units. Therefore one unit is about
$1.75^o$. In order to turn the target to $90^o$ one should set a value
of about 38 units. The default rotary position is at 0 units and
the target cannot be moved vertically being at a different position.
} % obsolete

\begin{safetyen}{20}{20}
\obsolete{
Before the target is moved vertically the target
movement should be ``masked'' by the MCC operators, since the vertical
movement may bring thick construction elements into the beam area
and therefore is connected to the Fast Shutdown (FSD). The target rotation
is safer and can be performed without ``masking'' the target movement
and is normally performed without turning off the beam.
A potentially dangerous target rotation to angles lower than $15^o$
is prevented mechanically. 
} % obsolete
The target  can be moved in two projections both by the MCC operators and by the Hall A
crew. The beam current applied should not exceed $2~\mu$A. It is allowed to move
the target  while the beam is on, however in this case the MCC operator must
mask the M{\o}ller target motion beforehand. Only the authorized personnel
from Hall A are allowed to move the target (see section~\ref{sec:moller-pers}).
Each time the MCC should be asked to provide a ``channel access'' to \mycomp{iochla}
for the duration of the measurements. 

The target motion is supervised using 2 TV cameras, displayed in
Hall A counting house. One camera is looking from the side and shows
a scale measuring the longitudinal position of the target. At the central
(default) position, the scale shows 31~mm. The second camera shows 
the horizontal position of the target rail. At the empty (default)
position the scale is centered about a mark ``20''.

One camera is looking from the side. A glass window in the target 
vacuum box allows one to see the beam area in the place where

Helmholtz coils, providing a field of about \obsolete{240~Gs} 350~Gs

\subsection {Spectrometer Description }
\label{sec:moller_compon_spectr}

The M{\o}ller polarimeter spectrometer consists of three quadrupole magnets and one
 dipole magnet (see Fig.\ref{fig:moller_layout}
 \infolevtwo{
   and also Fig.\ref{fig:moller_medm_1}
 }
 ):
\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\setlength{\itemsep}{-0.15cm}}
   \item quadrupole {\bf MQM1H02} (on the yoke labeled {\bf $PATSY$});
   \item quadrupole {\bf MQO1H03} (on the yoke labeled {\bf $TESSA$}); 
   \item quadrupole {\bf MQO1H03A} (on the yoke labeled {\bf $FELICIA$})
   \item dipole {\bf MMA1H01} (on the yoke marked as {\bf $University \, of \,
    Kentucky$}).
\end{list}

\infolevfour{
   The photograph on Fig.~\ref{fig:moller_spectr_phot1} shows the side view
   of the spectrometer.

            }
      \label{fig:moller_spectr_phot1} 
   \end{figure}  
}

These magnetic elements are controlled by MCC operators.

The spectrometer accepts electrons scattered close to the horizontal 
plane (see Fig.\ref{fig:moller_layout}). The acceptance in the azimuthal
angle is limited by a collimator in front of the dipole magnet, while
the detector vertical size and the magnetic field in the dipole magnet limit 
the acceptance in the scattering angle $\theta_{CM}$.

\infolevtwo{
 The electrons have to pass through
the beam pipe in the 
region of the quads, through the collimator in front of 
the dipole magnet, with a slit of 0.3-4~cm high, 
through two vertical
slits in the dipole, about 2~cm wide, positioned at $\pm$4~cm 
from the beam. These slits are terminated with vacuum tight windows
at the end of the dipole. The dipole deflects the scattered 
electrons down, towards the detector. 
The detector, consisting
of 2 arms - 2 vertical columns -  
is positioned such that electrons, scattered at $\theta_{CM}=90^o$ pass
close to its center. 
This acceptance is about $76<\theta_{CM}<104^o$. At beam energies below 1~GeV
the vertical slits in the dipole limit the acceptance to about
$83<\theta_{CM}<97^o$.
}

For a given beam energy there is an optimal setting of the currents in 
these 4 magnets%
\infolevtwo{ (see section~\ref{sec:moller_oper_magset})}.
At energies higher than 2.5~GeV it is possible
to optimize the beam line for both regular running and for 
M{\o}ller measurements. Typically, the dipole magnet should be turned on
only for the M{\o}ller measurements. 

\subsection {Detector}
\label{sec:moller_compon_det}

The M{\o}ller polarimeter detector is located in the shielding box downstream 
of the dipole and consists of two identical modules placed symmetrically about a vertical
plane containing the beam axis, thus enabling   
coincidence measurements.
Each part of the detector includes:
\begin{itemize}
%  \item An aperture detector consisting of a 28$\times$4cm$\times$1cm 
%        scintillator  with Plexiglas light guide and a Hamamatsu R1307 (3 inch)
%        photomultiplier tube.
 \item An aperture detector consists of four scintillators with light guides and 
       Hamamatsu R4124 (13~mm diameter) photomultiplier tubes connected to each segment. 
       Size of the aperture assembled detector is 31cm$\times$4cm$\times$3.6cm.
  \item A ``spaghetti'' lead - scintillating fiber calorimeter\footnote{
         before summer 2002 a lead glass calorimeter consisting of 4 
         8$\times$8$\times$30 cm$^3$
         was used. It lost a big fraction of the amplitude due
         to the radiation damage and deterioration of the optical contact.},
        consisting of 2 blocks 9$\times$15$\times$30~cm$^3$, each separated into 2
        channels equipped with Photonis XP2282B (2 inch) photomultiplier tubes. Thus,
        the vertical aperture is segmented into 4 calorimeter channels.
\end{itemize}
The HV crate is located in the Hall A rack 15 and is connected
to a portserver {\em hatsv5}, port 11.
HV for the lead glass detectors is tuned in order to align the M{\o}ller peak
position at a ADC channel 300 for each module, which means that the gain
of the the bottom modules is about 50\% higher than the gain of the top
modules.

\subsection {DAQ}
\label{sec:moller_compon_daq}

The DAQ%
\htmladdnormallinkfoot{}{(More details in: \url{http://www.jlab.org/~moller/guide1.2_linux.html})} 
 is based on CODA\cite{CODAwww} and runs at \mycomp{adaql2},
connecting to \mycomp{hallavme5}. The database server for CODA
is located on \mycomp{adaql1}. 

\subsection {Slow Control}
\label{sec:moller_compon_slow}

The Helmholtz coils are controlled via a script starting automatically
at the beginning of each CODA run. The polarity of the current in the coils
is reversed at every new run.

The HV, the electronics settings and the collimator position
are controlled from a Java program, equipped with a GUI%
\footnote{More details in \url{http://www.jlab.org/~moller/slow_mpc.html}}.

 Start the slow control task:
 \begin{list}{--}{\setlength{\itemsep}{-0.15cm}}
   \item Login to \mycomp{adaql1} as \mycomp{moller};
   \item \mycomp{adaql1$>$~cd~Java/msetting/}
   \item \mycomp{adaql1$>$~./mpc} - start the slow control task.
 \end{list}
 It may take about a minute to start all the components and read out
 the proper data from the electronic crates.

\section {Operating Procedure }
\label{sec:moller_oper}

The procedure includes general steps as follows: 
\begin{list}{$\bullet$}{\setlength{\itemsep}{-0.15cm}}
  \item ``Non-invasive'' preparations - start the appropriate
          computer processes, turn on the HV and learn the
          magnet settings needed;
  \item ``Invasive'' preparation: beam tuning with the regular
          magnet settings, loading the M{\o}ller settings,
          beam tuning, if neccessary, installing the M{\o}ller target;
  \item Detector check/tuning;
  \item Measurements;
  \item Restoring the regular settings.
\end{list}
The ``non-invasive'' preparations can be done without disturbing the running 
program in the Hall. It is reasonable to perform these preparations
before starting the ``invasive'' part.

In more details, the ``invasive'' procedure looks as follows:
 \begin{list}{--}{\setlength{\itemsep}{-0.15cm}}
   \item Remove the main target;
   \item Load the M{\o}ller settings in the magnets, keep the dipole off; 
   \item Tune the beam position with any convenient beam current;
   \item Turn on the M{\o}ller dipole; 
   \item Check the beam position;
   \item Tune the beam to $\sim{}0.5~\mu$A for M{\o}ller measurements; 
   \item Pull in the M{\o}ller target, using the TV camera to make sure the foil is at the
         window center;
   \item Make at least two CODA runs in order to use both coil polarities;
%   \item Make measurements at the forward target angle ($\sim{}23^\circ$);
%   \item Make 2 short runs at the normal target angle ($\sim{}90^\circ$);
%   \item Make measurements at the backward target angle ($\sim{}163^\circ$);
 \end{list}

\subsection {Initialization}
\label{sec:moller_oper_initial}

In order to control the operations several sessions
of \mycomp{moller} account must be opened at computers \mycomp{adaql1,...}.
The data analysis and some initial calculations are done using a PAW\cite{PAWwww}
session on  \mycomp{adaql1}:
 \begin{list}{--}{\setlength{\itemsep}{-0.15cm}}
   \item Login to \mycomp{adaql1} as \mycomp{moller};
   \item \mycomp{adaql1$>$~cd~paw/analysis}, start PAW (type \mycomp{paw}), select Workstation type 3.  
 \end{list}
\noindent

 \begin{list}{--}{\setlength{\itemsep}{-0.15cm}}
   \item Try \mycomp{telnet hatsv5 2003} and \mycomp{telnet hatsv5 2004};
   \item If a connection i refused - clean it up, by connecting
         \mycomp{telnet hatsv5} as root and typing \mycomp{kill 3} or \mycomp{kill 4},

   \item Login to \mycomp{adaql1} as \mycomp{moller}, make two sessions;
   \item \mycomp{adaql2$>$ kcoda} - clean up the old coda;
   \item Reset the VME board \mycomp{hallavme5} by: \mycomp{telnet hatsv5 2004}, \mycomp{-$>$ reboot};

   \item Click \mycomp{Connect} and select the configuration \mycomp{beam\_pol};
   \item Click \mycomp{Download} to download the program into the VME board.
 \end{list}

\subsection {Initial Beam Tune}
\label{sec:moller_oper_initbeam}

 Typically, the M{\o}ller measurements are taken during the regular Hall A
 running, when the beam has been tuned for this running. However,
 the M{\o}ller measurements require a different magnetic setting.
 At least the dipole magnet has to be turned on. This magnet
 slightly deflects the beam downward. The deflection at the main target
 could be 2-8~mm, depending on the beam energy. It is, therefore, 
 useful to tune the beam position before the dipole is turned on. It can be done
 before the magnets are set to the M{\o}ller mode.
 The requirements for straight beam are: 
 \begin{list}{--}{\setlength{\itemsep}{-0.15cm}}
%   \item On BPM IPM1H01 (in front of the M{\o}ller target) $|X|<0.2$~mm, $|Y|<0.2$~mm.
%   \item On BPM IPM1H04A/B $|X|<2$~mm, $|Y|<2$~mm.
   \item On BPM IPM1H01 (in front of the M{\o}ller target) $|X|<0.1$~mm, $|Y|<0.1$~mm.
   \item On BPM IPM1C20 (upstrean of the Compton chicane)  $|X|<0.1$~mm, $|Y|<0.1$~mm.
 \end{list}
 The request should be given to MCC. 

\subsection {The Magnet Settings}
\label{sec:moller_oper_magset}

 In order to find the proper settings for the given beam energy, say 3.25~GeV, 
 type on the PAW session: \\ 
 \hspace*{0.5cm} \mycomp{PAW$>$~exec~sett\_magp~e0=3.25 nq=3} for 3-quad configuration \\
 \hspace*{0.5cm} \mycomp{PAW$>$~exec~sett\_magp~e0=3.25 nq=2} for 2-quad configuration \\
 The printed values for $GL$ and $BdL$ should be checked with the current values,
 displayed on the MEDM window~\ref{sec:moller_compon_medm}. 
 The MCC should be asked to load the M{\o}ller settings in the magnets -
 they have a tool to load the proper settings for the M{\o}ller
 magnets and a few other magnets on the beam line. 
 The set values should be compared with the calculated values%
 \footnote{A reasonable accuracy in the  magnets settings is about 1-2\%}.
 \begin{safetyen}{5}{2}
   The beam must be turned off when the magnets are tuned.
 \end{safetyen}


\subsection {Final Beam Tune}
\label{sec:moller_oper_finalbeam}

 The beam parameters for M{\o}ller measurements
 are: 
   \begin{list}{--}{\setlength{\itemsep}{-0.15cm}}        
     \item \begin{safetyen}{5}{0} the beam current $\sim{}0.5~\mu$A and $<2~\mu$A;
            \end{safetyen}
     \item the beam current should be reduced mainly by closing the ``slit''
           in the injector (not by the laser attenuator), in order to
           reduce the effect of current leak-through from the other halls.
   \end{list}


\subsection {Target Motion}
\label{sec:moller_oper_target}
 The procedure is as follows:
% MCC should be asked to: %put in one of the targets (typically, the \mycomp{bottom}
   \begin{list}{--}{\setlength{\itemsep}{-0.15cm}}        
     \item Ask the MCC to mask the main target (cryotarget or whatever) motion
           and remove the main target, then ask the MCC to unmask the motion;
     \item Ask the MCC to mask the M{\o}ller target motion;
     \item Move to target to the position needed (say, 5) using
           the MEDM screen \infolevtwo{(see Fig.~\ref{fig:moller_medm_1})}.
           Check that the target is close to the center of the window
           in the TV camera screen. 
   \end{list}

%\infolevtwo{
% (see Fig.~\ref{fig:moller_medm_1})
%}
% target is used). 
%The requirements for the target motion are:
% \begin{safetyen}{10}{10}
%    \begin{list}{--}{\setlength{\itemsep}{-0.15cm}}
%       \item Vertical motion: beam OFF, target motion MASKED.
%       \item Rotation: no constraint, the beam can be ON. 
%    \end{list}
% \end{safetyen}

 %Ask the MCC to resume the same beam and check the Ion Chamber
 %{\bf SLD1H03} reading. It should not exceed 1000. At beam energies
 %above 1.6 GeV it should not exceed 300.

\subsection{Detector Tuning and Checking }
\label{sec:dettune}

The goal is to check that the detector is working, that the counting rates
are normal and that the M{\o}ller peaks are located at about ADC channel 300
for all the calorimeter blocks.

                       of the left and right arms.
                       The histogram 11 (sum of both arms) should contain a clean peak at

\section {Safety Assessment}
\label{sec:moller_safety}
\end{safetyen}


\begin{safetyen}{50}{50}
\subsection{Magnets}

Particular care must be taken in working in the vicinity of the
magnetic elements of the polarimeter as they can have large currents
running in them. The quadrupole magnets and the leads for the dipole magnet 
are protected with Plexiglas shields. Removing the shields
can be done by Hall A technical staff, with the power supplies
turned off and using the ``Lock out / Tag out'' procedure. All the personnel involved
must have ``Lock out / Tag out'' training.
Only members of the M{\o}ller polarimeter group and Hall A technical staff are
authorized to work in the immediate vicinity of the magnets with the shields
removed.

As with all elements of the
polarimeter which can
affect the beamline, the magnets are controlled by MCC. There are four
red lights which indicate the status of the magnets. The dipole has two
lights which are activated via a magnetic field sensitive switch placed
on the coils of the dipole. One light is placed on the floor on beam left,
and the other is placed on the raised walkway on beam right. The quadrupoles
have similarly placed lights (one on the floor on beam left and one
on the walkway), and are lit up when any one of the M{\o}ller quads is 
energized. The status of the quadrupole power supplies is on the 
checklist for
closing up Hall A. 

The power supply (62~V, 500~A rating) for
the dipole is located in the Beam Switch yard Building (Building 98). 
The maximum current for the dipole is 450A. The
quadrupole power supplies (40~V, 330~A rating) are located in Hall A electronics rack 13.

\subsection{Vacuum System}

One must be careful in working near the downstream side of the dipole
magnet, as there are two 2 by 16 cm, 4 mil thick titanium windows.
The windows are partially protected by a lead collimator downstream
of the dipole. 
Only members of the M{\o}ller polarimeter group should work in this
area. 
If work is done on the collimators, the appropriate ear
and eye protection should be used.

\subsection{High Voltage}

There are 38 photomultiplier tubes within the detector
shielding hut, with a maximum voltage of 3000 V. The detector is serviced
by sliding it back on movable rails. The high voltage must be turned
off during any detector movement. Only members of the M{\o}ller group
should move the detector.\\

\subsection{Target}

To avoid damage to the M{\o}ller target, the target should not be in the beam 
if the beam current is greater than
5 $\mu$A. 
%Only MCC can move the target, but 
The experimenters
are responsible for ensuring that the M{\o}ller target is removed from the beam
for regular running and that its position is unmasked. \\
