\section{Special Procedures for \HALL}

There are no special procedures for this experiment.

%\EXPTS uses only standard equipment and thus only standard rocedures are required.

%Beyond the information covered in the Hall A standard equipment manual,
%a special operational safety proceedure, OSP-XXXX has been written for this
%experimental period.  OSP-XXXX covers all aspects the tritium target safety
%including the stricted access to the Hall and special training requirements.

%Each shift requires a shift leader and target operator with tritium target training.
%A third person on shift is extremely useful, but not required. The shift leader 
%has the standard
%duties of shift leader to ensure proper data taking, log all activity, and to fill out
%the Beam Accounting form.  The target operator should focus on tritium target
%operation.  Training is arranged by Dave Meekins.  The shift leader or third
%shift worker will run the DAQ and online analysis codes.
%Other then the special tritium target, the experiment only uses the ``standard'' Hall A equipment whose
%use and safety procedures are documented in the Hall A OSP (Operation Safety
%Procedures) available from the Hall A web page.
