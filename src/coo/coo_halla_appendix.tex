\section{Special Procedures for \HALL}

\begin{itemize}

\item{
A special tritium target training, SAF110T, is now required for all shift workers.
}

\item{
When the tritium target is installed in the Hall A scattering chamber, the Hall shall
will require badge access.   Each person should badge in seperately.
}

\item{
The tritium target must be in the "HOME" position to initiate a a controlled access.
During a controlled access target may only be moved by system experts.
}

\item{
If all other trainings are up-to-date, the Hall A walk-through, SAF1110, can be arranged 
with Jaiver Gomez or Douglas Higinbotham; though during operations those training will only 
happen opertunitistically.   
}

\item{
No one shall enter the fence area around the target or the dump area between the HRS without
premision from the radioligcal control group.  
}

\end{itemize}

Further details about the tritium target, as well as, details of the tritium target proceedures
can be found at: \url{https://wiki.jlab.org/jlab_tritium_target_wiki}.
 
%\EXPTS uses only standard equipment and thus only standard rocedures are required.

%Beyond the information covered in the Hall A standard equipment manual,
%a special operational safety proceedure, OSP-XXXX has been written for this
%experimental period.  OSP-XXXX covers all aspects the tritium target safety
%including the stricted access to the Hall and special training requirements.

\section{Special Procedures for \EXPTS}

Though the installation of a tritium target has added to the special prodcures for
the Hall; the experiments themselves are relatively staight forward; using  
simply the HRS spectrometers and low beam currents ($\approx 20 \mu A$). 

\begin{itemize}

\item{
Target operators will need to read a supplimental training document:
\url{https://misportal.jlab.org/jlabDocs/document.seam?id=100753}.
}

\item{
Sepcial proceedures have been developed for the beam centering:
\url{ https://misportal.jlab.org/jlabDocs/document.seam?id=100572}
}

\item{
Special proceedure have been developed for the target boiling study:
\url{https://misportal.jlab.org/jlabDocs/document.seam?id=100353}
}

\end{itemize}

%Each shift requires a shift leader and target operator with tritium target training.
%A third person on shift is extremely useful, but not required. The shift leader 
%has the standard
%duties of shift leader to ensure proper data taking, log all activity, and to fill out
%the Beam Accounting form.  The target operator should focus on tritium target
%operation.  Training is arranged by Dave Meekins.  The shift leader or third
%shift worker will run the DAQ and online analysis codes.
%Other then the special tritium target, the experiment only uses the ``standard'' Hall A equipment whose
%use and safety procedures are documented in the Hall A OSP (Operation Safety
%Procedures) available from the Hall A web page.

\section{Signature Sheets}

After reading this document, as well as the ESAD, RSAD, and ERG, workers need to sign
the signature sheet located in the ``yellow binder'' of the experiment specific documents.
This binder can be found in the \HALL\ counting house and in the MCC.
