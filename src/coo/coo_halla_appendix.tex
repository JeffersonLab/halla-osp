two operational safety proceedures have been written.
OSP-43091
provides safety information about the DVCS detector setup.  OSP-43679 provides

\section{Special Procedures for \EXPTS}

Each shift requires a shift leader and, if the cryotarget is cold, a cryotarget 
operator.  A third person on shift is extremely useful, but not required. The shift leader 
has the standard
duties of shift leader to ensure proper data taking, log all activity, and to fill out
the Beam Accounting form. The cryotarget operator should focus on cryotarget
operation. Training is arranged by Jian-Ping Chen. The shift leader or third
shift worker will run the DAQ and online analysis codes.
This run period uses the ``standard'' Hall A equipment whose
use and safety procedures are documented in the Hall A OSP (Operation Safety
Procedures) available from the Hall A web page.

\section{Signature Sheets}

After reading this document, as well as the ESAD, RSAD, and ERG, workers need to sign
the signature sheet located in the ``yellow binder'' of the experiment specific documents.
This binder can be found in the \HALL\ counting house and in the MCC.
