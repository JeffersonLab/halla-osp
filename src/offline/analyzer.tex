The standard offline analysis software for Hall A data is the 
``C++ Analyzer'', an object-oriented C++ class package developed at Jefferson
Lab by Hall A staff. The Analyzer is built onto the 
ROOT\htmladdnormallinkfoot{}{\url{http://root.cern.ch}} programming
framework. All of ROOT's analysis and visualization tools are available,
as well as specialized code for Hall A physics analysis. 
The current version of the Analyzer is \cppaver. Detailed information about the
software (downloads, documentation, etc.) can be found at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://hallaweb.jlab.org/root/}.
\end{center}

Due to its object-oriented design, the Analyzer is modular and extensible.
Individual analysis components are designed as plug-in modules
that can be added as needed. As a result, the scope of the data analysis is 
to a large extent user-configurable. Only data from those spectrometers and 
detectors is analyzed, and only those physics calculations are carried out
that the user specifies. Reconfiguration can be done at run 
time without any need for recompilation of the program.

Currently supported are the analysis of the Hall A HRS spectrometers,
the beamline instrumentation, scaler and EPICS slow control data, and 
helicity information. The event decoder is compatible with the CODA
event data format described in the section on Data Acquisition. 
Decoding of basic helicity information as well as a sophisticated
algorithm for decoding and prediction of the G0 helicity sequence is
possible. The following detectors can be used in either HRS spectrometer:
\begin{itemize} \setlength{\parskip}{0ex}
  \item Vertical Drift Chambers (VDCs)
  \item Scintillators (one or more paddles with up to two PMTs each)
  \item Cherenkov counters (arbitrary number of PMTs/mirrors, 
        usable for both gas Cherenkovs and aerogels in each HRS)
  \item Shower counters (shower, preshower, pion rejectors with 
        arbitrary organization in terms of rows and columns of blocks)
  \item Total shower counter (combination of a preshower and shower)
\end{itemize}
The VDC code performs tracking in the focal plane and reconstruction to the
target. The tracking algorithm has been shown to be accurate for events 
with one cluster per plane. Noisy events with higher cluster multiplicity
and events with more than one good track in the focal plane may not be
reconstructed correctly by the present version of the code, but work is in
progress to make this type of analysis also reliable.

The scintillator, Cherenkov, and shower counter classes perform basic decoding,
calibration (offset/pedestal subtraction, gain multiplication), and summing 
(for Cherenkovs) or cluster-finding (for showers) of hits. 
The cluster-finding algorithm of the shower class is basic and currently 
only capable of finding a single cluster per event. These classes are largely
generic and should be able to accommodate most new detectors of the respective 
type, even with a different geometry and number of channels.

Several beamline apparatuses are available: a dummy beam (always at zero 
position and angle), an ``unrastered'' beam, and a ``rastered'' beam. 
BPM and raster detectors are implemented and 
can be analyzed to obtain the beam position
on an event-by-event basis.  The BPM code currently only supports
standard ADCs (e.g.\ LeCroy), not the older Struck readout.

To carry out standard post-reconstruction calculations, the following
Physics Modules are available:
\begin{itemize} \setlength{\parskip}{0ex}
  \item Single-arm electron kinematics ($Q^2$, $\omega$ etc.)
  \item Coincidence kinematics (missing energy etc.)
  \item Coincidence time
  \item Reaction point (vertex position) reconstruction 
  \item Extended target tracking corrections
\end{itemize}
As many physics
modules as needed can be added to the analyzer before starting replay.
Identical modules can be added multiple times with different parameters.
For example, on can calculate ``electron kinematics'' using both uncorrected
and energy-loss corrected tracks in one analysis pass without modifying
or recompiling any code. For experiments requiring
specialized calculations of kinematics or any other quantities,
writing a new physics module is the preferred approach. 

The results of calculations performed by the various analysis modules 
(spectrometers, detectors, physics modules) are made available via 
so-called global variables. 
Global variables provide access to data via names (text strings). 
Scalars as well as fixed and variable-size arrays are supported.
The global variable names are used in the definition of the analysis output
and of logicals. 

To control the analysis flow, to collect statistics, and to select
interesting data, tests and cuts (``logicals'') can be defined
dynamically at run time.  If certain tests fail for a given event,
further analysis of that event is skipped, and the event is not
included in the output.  Such tests can be put at the end of all the
major stages of the analysis.  This allows making decisions about an
event early in the analysis, improving performance.  A summary of all
test results is written to a file at the end of the analysis.

Data of interest can be histogrammed and/or written to
a ROOT Tree in the output file.  The contents of the output
is defined dynamically at the beginning of the analysis.
Both 1- and 2-dimensional histograms are supported. Histograms
can be filled selectively using logical expressions (cuts).

%--- Procedures
\infolevtwo{
\subsection{Running the Analyzer}
Precompiled binaries of the latest version of the Analyzer are
installed on the Hall A counting house analysis machines 
(adaql3--5, adaqs2--3). To run the Analyzer, log into any
standard account on these computers, for example as \mycomp{adaq},
and type\\

\noindent\mycomp{analyzer}
\vspace{2ex}

As installed, the Analyzer uses the default database in
the location pointed to by the environment variable \mycomp{DB\_DIR}.
The Hall A staff makes an effort to keep this database reasonably 
up-to-date for completed experiments. If you wish to analyze older data,
the default database might work for you. However, 
if you wish to use a customized set of database files
specific to your experiment (usually the case for the current experiment), 
you will need to re-define \mycomp{DB\_DIR} to
point to the location of that database before starting the Analyzer.
For details on the database, see Section~\ref{offl:sec:database}.

The pre-installed analyzer may not work in certain accounts if 
the \mycomp{PATH} and/or \mycomp{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} variables have been
changed from the system defaults. If this is the case, you should
correct the login script(s) of the problematic account.
To restore the system defaults, you may execute one of the following 
commands:

\begin{tabbing}
For csh/tcsh shells:$\qquad$ \= \mycomp{source /adaqfs/apps/env/login.adaq}\\
For bash shells:     \> \mycomp{source /adaqfs/apps/env/profile.adaq}
\end{tabbing}

If the Analyzer is to be used outside of the Hall A counting house
environment, it is currently necessary to build the program from source.
A {\tt tar} archive of the sources can be obtained from the following
location

\subsection{Preparing Analysis of a New Experiment}
\label{offl:sec:newexpt}
Setting up offline analysis for a new experiment typically 
involves the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Determine the experimental configuration (spectrometers,
        detectors, beamline) to be analyzed and identify the corresponding 
	analysis modules. \label{offl:item:step1}
  \item Create a database for the new experiment, using the
        start date of the data taking as the time-stamp for new
	new entries (see Section~\ref{offl:sec:database}).
	At the minimum the database should contain up-to-date
	detector map entries for every detector and rough starting
	values for the spectrometer reconstruction matrix elements
	and VDC timing offsets. Often this information can be
	carried over from a previous experiment with only minor
	modifications. Also, enter any other calibrations and geometry
	data that are available, even if approximate.
  \item In the database, create initial run database values.
        These are typically the starting beam energy and spectrometer
	momentum and angle settings. If the experiment is already completed,
	extract the history of these settings from logs and enter them
	into the database. These values affect the kinematics calculations;
	they are not important for detector checkout.
  \item Determine which physics calculations are needed for the
        offline analysis and identify corresponding Physics Modules.
	\label{offl:item:step3}
  \item Identify desired output histograms and tree variables.
        Create an output definition file. The file 
        \mycomp{\$ANALYZER/examples/output\_example.def} contains
	most of the necessary documentation.
  \item If desired, create a definition file for logicals.
        An example generating detailed VDC statistics is
	given in \mycomp{\$ANALYZER/examples/cuts\_example.def}.
  \item Write a CINT\footnote{CINT is a C/C++ interpreter that acts
        as the interactive interface to ROOT and the C++ Analyzer.}
        script that sets up the configuration identified in 
	Step~\ref{offl:item:step1} and the physics analysis decided on
	in Step~\ref{offl:item:step3}. Often, a script from a
	previous experiment, or one of the examples in
	the directory \mycomp{\$ANALYZER/examples}, can serve as a guide.
	The script usually also locates raw data files, creates
	one or more \mycomp{THaRun} objects, configures various
	options of the event loop object \mycomp{THaAnalyzer}, and
	starts the replay. In particular, the names of the output
	file, the output definition file, and the logicals definition
	file must be given to \mycomp{THaAnalyzer}.
  \item Identify the plots that you wish to generate from the analysis
        results and write a script to create them. This may be part
	of the script created in the previous step. 
	Note that there is no need to quit the Analyzer and start a new
	session or another program after completion of the analysis; all of
	ROOT's visualization tools are available from within the Analyzer.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Database Files and Directories}
\label{offl:sec:database}
Version \cppaver\ of the C++ Analyzer uses simple ASCII text files
to store database information. There is one file for each 
analysis module. The name of each file is composed as follows:\\

\noindent \mycomp{db\_apparatusname.detectorname.dat}
\vspace{2ex}

For example, a Cherenkov detector named ``a1'' which is part of the
Left HRS spectrometer, named ``L'', would be associated with 
a database file named \mycomp{db\_L.a1.dat}.

The ``run database'', which contains global run-specific parameters
such as beam energy and spectrometer momentum and angle settings,
is stored in a special file named \mycomp{db\_run.dat}.

All of the above database files should be stored in a location
that can be modified by the user, for instance in \mycomp{$\tilde{}$/DB}.
{\bf The environment variable \mycomp{DB\_DIR}
must be defined to point to this top-level database
directory.} Since database parameters change with time, database files
are organized in time-dependent subdirectories within \mycomp{\$DB\_DIR}.
The name of each subdirectory has the form \mycomp{YYYYMMDD}, where 
\mycomp{YYYY}, \mycomp{MM} and \mycomp{DD} 
represent the year, month, and day, resp., of the 
date that is the start of the validity of the entries. Upon initialization,
the Analyzer locates the most appropriate time-dependent subdirectory based on
the contents of \mycomp{\$DB\_DIR} 
and the time-stamp of the run to be replayed.
Often there is only one time-dependent subdirectory per experiment, but
if significant changes occur during an experiment, it may be appropriate to
create several directories.
A finer division of time-dependent information
can be provided by timestamps within each database file. This
is especially true for the run database file which frequently
will have many time-stamped sections.

For example, an experiment running in April and May of 2004 would
create a database subdirectory \mycomp{$\tilde{}$/DB/20040401} and set
\mycomp{DB\_DIR=$\;\tilde{}$/DB}. Other files supporting the replay
of this experiment would reside in an experiment-specific
directory, usually \mycomp{\$EXPERIMENT}.

\subsection{Program Design Overview}
Spectrometers (and similar major installations) are abstracted in an
Apparatus class hierarchy, while individual detectors belong to a
Detector class hierarchy. Apparatuses are collections of detectors
that are analyzed in a particular way. Specialized physics analysis,
such as kinematics calculations, vertex determination, and energy loss
corrections, can be done in Physics Modules.  All three types of
objects, Apparatuses, Detectors, and Physics Modules, are kept in
lists that are processed during replay. In setting up the replay, it
is up to the user which objects to place in the lists.

%\infolevfour{
%The class hierarchies of Apparatuses and Detectors are shown in 
%Figures~\ref{offl:fig:apparatus-hierarchy} 
%and \ref{offl:fig:detector-hierarchy}.
%}
Both the Apparatus and the Detector class hierarchies,
as well as the Physics Modules, inherit from a common base class, 
\mycomp{THaAnalysisObject}.  
%describe details of hierarchies
Physics Modules currently do not use a
particular class hierarchy; all physics modules inherit from
\mycomp{THaPhysicsModule}, which in turn inherits from 
\mycomp{THaAnalysisObject}.

The behavior of existing analysis modules can be modified or extended
easily by using class inheritance. In such a case, the only code that
needs to be written is the implementation of the new feature.  For
example, the standard Cherenkov detector class currently only
calculates the total sum of ADC amplitudes. For a new type of
Cherenkov counter, or to do a more sophisticated analysis of the
standard Cherenkov detectors, one might want to calculate separate ADC
sums for certain groups of PMTs.  To do so, one would write a new
class inheriting from the standard Cherenkov class, which could
contain as little as one function, performing the additional
calculations, and the corresponding data members.  New types of
detectors and even entire spectrometers, as well as new types of
physics calculations, can be added similarly easily, again using class
inheritance.  No change to and no rebuilding of the core program is
necessary to support such new modules.
