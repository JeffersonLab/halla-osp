\section{The Hall A Gas System}

\subsection{Overview}
The Hall A detector gas systems are located in the Hall A Gas Shed
alongside of the truck ramp for Hall A.  The gas cylinders in use
are along the outside of the Gas Shed in a fenced area.
There are racks next to
the Gas Shed for storage of full gas cylinders.  On the other side of the
truck ramp there are racks for storage of both full and empty cylinders.
Hall A currently uses ethane, argon, ethanol, two grades of CO2
and nitrogen.

One system uses two cylinders of SFC grade CO2 (without a helium head).
This is for the gas Cerenkov counters in the HRS detector arrays.

One system uses two cylinders of Coleman grade CO2.  This is for
flushing the aerogel Cerenkov counters in the HRS detector arrays.

One system uses a single cylinder of Coleman grade CO2.  This is for
the gas Cerenkov counter in the (e,p) setup in the beamline.

One system uses two cylinders of Zero grade argon and two cylinders
of Chemically Pure grade of ethane.  This is for all the HRS wire chambers
of both arms.  The two gases are mixed inside the Gas Shed and bubbled
through ethyl alcohol.  Details of this system can be found in the
Hall A Wire-chamber Gas System (HAWGS) manual.  A copy of the current
manual is in Counting Room A and on the Hall A web page.

One cylinder of Industrial grade nitrogen is used to provide pressurized
gas for a few automatic cylinder switch-overs in the systems.

Maintenance of the gas system is routinely performed by the Hall A
technical staff.  Shift personnel are not expected to be responsible
for maintaining the detector gas systems.  Unexpected maintenance
requirements should be handled by contacting

\item[~]Jack(John) Segal - pager and phone are both extension 7242
\item[~]Hall A Technician on call
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Gas Alarms}

In Counting Room A there are two alarm panels associated with the gas
systems for the detectors.  They are located on the far left end of the
control console, mounted one above the other.  The upper panel is a
Gas Master flammable gas monitoring system.  The lower panel is a gas
systems status indicator.  The Gas Master system will go into alarm if
elevated levels of flammable gas are present in either of the Detector
Shielding Huts or the Gas Shed.  The Gas Master system will also go into
alarm if the magnets vent cryogens.  The gas systems status will
alarm if any of a number of faults are detected in the Hall A Wire-chamber
Gas System.  The led for the specific fault will turn red to indicate which
fault caused the alarm.

Response to an alarm should be to contact either of the personnel listed above.
