 Files needed for the Hall OPS Manual chapter on DAQ and
 Trigger are the following.  

    1. daq.tex   (the latex file)
    2. etrig.epsi     (encapsulated postscript figure)
    3. htrig.epsi         "            "         "
    4. coinc.epsi         "            "         "

 The file daq.tex compiles "as is".  But to incorporate
 it into a larger tex file one must comment out the stuff
 at the top (up to \begin{document}) and also the line at
 the end (\end {document})
