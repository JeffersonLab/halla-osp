The following tools are available for checking
data online.


\subsection{Scaler Display and Scaler Events}
Scaler rates and values are displayed using
a ROOT based display called \mycomp{xscaler}.

Normally this is already running on \mycomp{adaql4} but 
if it is not running, login as
adaq and go to the appropriate directory
by typing ``goxscaler''.
Then type \mycomp{./xscaler} there.  
The scalers are cleared at
the beginning of each CODA run.
Scalers are read out at approximately 0.5 Hz 
and injected into the CODA data-stream 
as event type 140.  A file
\mycomp{scaler\_history.dat} is maintained which is
a complete history of scaler readings at
the end of each run that ended normally.
For 1-TS mode, this file is in \mycomp{/adaqfs/halla/adaq/scaler}.

\section{Analysis using C++ Analyzer}
\label{sec:onl-ofl-analysis}

Podd is the main offline software package
for analyzing Hall A experiments.
This code is documented in a separate chapter
but it is worth mentioning here in a list of
essential tools for checking data online.
