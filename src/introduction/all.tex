\section{Overview}

        The following Hall A subsystems are considered part of the experimental endstation base equipment. 
Many of these subsystems impose similar hazards, such as those induced by magnets and magnet power supplies, 
high voltage systems and cryogenic systems.  Note that a specific sub-system may have many different hazards associated with it.
For each major system, the hazards, mitigations, and responsible personnal are noted.

The material in this chapter is a subset of the material in the full Hall A operations manual and is only intended to familiarize
people with the hazards and responsible personnel for these systems.  It in no way should be taken as sufficent information to
use or operate this equipment.
